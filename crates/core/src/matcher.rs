//! Value matching traits.

//! This could use a better name. The basic funcionality
//! checks values for inclusion in a group. I don't
//! think it's an equivalance class but maybe something
//! along those lines.

/// Basic matcher trait. Represents a class of values
/// for which inclusion can be tested.

/// this.

    type Target;

    /// Match a specific resource
    fn match_only<T: Into<Self::Target>>(target: T) -> Self;
